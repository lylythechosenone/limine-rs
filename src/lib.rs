//! Rust Bindings for the limine boot protocol.
//!
//! # Examples
//! An example kernel using this crate can be found
//! [here](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-rust-barebones). For
//! smaller usage examples, see [usage](#usage).
//!
//! # Crate features
//! - `uuid`: Implements `Into<uuid::Uuid>` and `From<uuid::Uuid>` for [`file::Uuid`].
//! - `ipaddr`: Enables functions in [`file::File`] to return `Ipv4Addr`. This
//!   is feature gated because it will only appear in stable on Rust 1.77.0, on
//!   March 21st.
//!
//! # Revisions
//! Many types in the limine boot protocol have associated revisions. These
//! signify various added fields and changes to the protocol. For requests, if a
//! bootloader doesn't support a revision, it will simply process it as if it is
//! the highest revision it does support. The bootloader will only return the
//! latest supported revision in responses. The response revision is
//! automatically checked by the types in this crate, and types that may not be
//! returned are wrapped in an [`Option`].
//!
//! In this crate, you may specify the revisions of your requests via
//! `with_revision`, but you likely just want to use `new`. This will use the
//! latest revision supported by this crate.
//!
//! # Usage
//! The first thing you need to do is place a [`BaseRevision`] tag somewhere in
//! your code. This tag is used to identify what revision of the protocol your
//! kernel requires. Without this tag, the bootloader will assume revision 0,
//! which is likely not what you want.
//!
//! The [`BaseRevision`] tag can be placed anywhere in your code, like so:
//! ```rust
//! use limine::BaseRevision;
//!
//! // Require version 1 or higher
//! pub static BASE_REVISION: BaseRevision = BaseRevision::new();
//! ```
//!
//! Next, you can place any requests you would like. For example, to request a
//! larger stack (*recommended on debug Rust builds*), you can do the following:
//! ```rust
//! use limine::request::StackSizeRequest;
//!
//! // Some reasonable size
//! pub const STACK_SIZE: u64 = 0x100000;
//!
//! // Request a larger stack
//! pub static STACK_SIZE_REQUEST: StackSizeRequest = StackSizeRequest::new().with_size(STACK_SIZE);
//! ```

// `Default` is not const anyway, so implementing is not very useful.
